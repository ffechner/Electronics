For simplicity the family letters after the 74 are omitted in the diagrams below because the pin connections apply

<p>If you are using another reference please be aware that there is some variation in the terms used to describe pin functions,
for example <strong>reset</strong> is also called <strong>clear</strong>. Some inputs are 'active low' which means they perform
their function when low. If you see a line drawn above a label it means it is active low, for example:&nbsp;

<h2>74 series families</h2>
<div class="wrapfull">
<div class="colhalf">
<p>The <strong>74LS</strong> (Low-power Schottky) family (like the original) uses TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) circuitry
which is fast but requires more power than later families. The 74 series is often still called the 'TTL series'
even though the latest ICs do not use TTL!</p>
<p>The <strong>74HC</strong> family has High-speed CMOS circuitry, combining the speed of TTL with the very low power
consumption of the <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/cmos.htm">4000&nbsp;series</a>. They are CMOS ICs with the same pin arrangements as the older 74LS family.
Note that 74HC inputs cannot be reliably driven by 74LS outputs because the voltage ranges used for logic 0
are not quite compatible, use 74HCT instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="colhalf">
<p>The <strong>74HCT</strong> family is a special version of 74HC with 74LS TTL-compatible inputs so 74HCT can be
safely mixed with 74LS in the same system. In fact 74HCT can be used as low-power direct replacements for
the older 74LS ICs in most circuits. The minor disadvantage of 74HCT is a lower immunity to noise, but
this is unlikely to be a problem in most situations.</p>
<p><strong>For most new projects the 74HC family is the best choice.</strong>
The 74LS and 74HCT families require a 5V supply so they are not convenient for battery operation.</p>
</div></div>

<div id="opencollector" class="clearboth"></div><hr>

<h2>Open Collector Outputs</h2>
<div class="wrap320">
<div class="colflex">
<p>Some 74 series ICs have open collector outputs, this means they can <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#sinksource">sink</a>
current but they cannot <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#sinksource">source</a> current. They behave like an NPN
<a href="https://electronicsclub.info/transistorcircuits.htm#switching">transistor&nbsp;switch</a>.</p>
<p>The diagram shows how an open collector output can be connected to sink current from a supply which has a
higher voltage than the logic IC supply. The maximum load supply is 15V for most open collector ICs.</p>
<p>Open collector outputs can be safely connected together to switch on a load when any one of them is low;
unlike normal outputs which must be combined <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#combining">using&nbsp;diodes</a>.</p>

<div class="wrapfull">
<div class="colhalf">
<h2>74HC and 74HCT family characteristics</h2>
<p>The CMOS circuitry used in the <strong>74HC</strong> and <strong>74HCT</strong> series ICs means that they are
<a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#static">static sensitive</a>. Touching a pin while charged with static electricity
(from your clothes for example) may damage the IC. In fact most ICs in regular use are quite tolerant
and earthing your hands by touching a metal water pipe or window frame before handling them will be adequate.
ICs should be left in their protective packaging until you are ready to use them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>74HC Supply:</strong> 2 to 6V, small fluctuations are tolerated.</li>
<li><strong>74HCT Supply:</strong> 5V ±0.5V, a regulated supply is best.</li>
<li><strong>Inputs</strong> have very high impedance (resistance), this is good because it means
they will not affect the part of the circuit where they are connected. However, it also means that unconnected
inputs can easily pick up electrical noise and rapidly change between high and low states in an unpredictable way.
This is likely to make the IC behave erratically and it will significantly increase the supply current.
To prevent problems <strong>all unused inputs MUST be connected to the supply (either +Vs or 0V)</strong>,
this applies even if that part of the IC is not being used in the circuit!
<br><strong>Note that 74HC inputs cannot be reliably driven by 74LS outputs</strong> because the voltage ranges used
for logic 0 are not quite compatible. For reliability use <strong>74HCT</strong> if the system includes some 74LS ICs.</li>
<li><strong>Outputs</strong> can <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#sinksource">sink and source</a> about 4mA if you wish to maintain
the correct output voltage to drive logic inputs, but if there is no need to drive any inputs the maximum current is about 20mA.
To switch larger currents you can <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/transistorcircuits.htm#ic">connect&nbsp;a&nbsp;transistor</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Fan-out:</strong> one output can drive many inputs (50+), except 74LS inputs because
these require a higher current and only 10 can be driven.</li>
<li><strong>Gate propagation time</strong>: about 10ns for a signal to travel through a gate.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: up to 25MHz.</li>
<li><strong>Power consumption</strong> (of the IC itself) is very low, a few µW.
It is much greater at high frequencies, a few mW at 1MHz for example.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="colhalf">
<h2>74LS family TTL characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supply:</strong> 5V ±0.25V, it must be very smooth, a regulated supply is best*.
In addition to the normal supply smoothing, a 0.1µF capacitor should be connected across the supply near
the IC to remove the 'spikes' generated as it switches state, one capacitor is needed for every 4 ICs.
<br>* <em>In my experience 74LS ICs usually work successfully with a 4.5V battery supply in simple and undemanding
low frequency circuits but I certainly don't recommend this for any circuit with a serious purpose
as it's outside the rated voltage range.</em></li>
<li><strong>Inputs</strong> 'float' high to logic 1 if unconnected, but do not rely on this in a permanent
(soldered) circuit because the inputs may pick up electrical noise. 1mA must be drawn out to hold inputs at logic 0.
In a permanent circuit it is wise to connect any unused inputs to +Vs to ensure good immunity to noise.</li>
<li><strong>Outputs</strong> can <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#sinksource">sink</a> up to 16mA (enough to light an LED),
but they can <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/ics.htm#sinksource">source</a> only about 2mA. To switch larger currents you can
<a href="https://electronicsclub.info/transistorcircuits.htm#ic">connect&nbsp;a&nbsp;transistor</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Fan-out</strong>: one output can drive up to 10 74LS inputs, but many more 74HCT inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Gate propagation time</strong>: about 10ns for a signal to travel through a gate.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: up to about 35MHz (under the right conditions).</li>
<li><strong>Power consumption</strong> (of the IC itself) is a few mW.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note"><h4>For most new projects the 74HC family is the best choice.</h4>
<p>The 74LS and 74HCT families require a 5V supply so they are not convenient for battery operation.
If you are used to using the 74LS series remember that 74HC and 74HCT inputs do not float high when unconnected
so unused inputs must be connected to +Vs or 0V for reliable operation.</p>

<h3>Mixing Logic Families</h3>
<div class="wrap320"><div class="colflex">
<p>It is best to build a circuit using just one logic family, but if necessary the different families may be
mixed providing the power supply is suitable for all of them. For example mixing <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/cmos.htm">4000</a> and 74HC requires the
power supply to be in the range 3 to 6V. A circuit which includes 74LS or 74HCT ICs must have a 5V supply.</p>
<p>A 74LS output cannot reliably drive a <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/cmos.htm">4000</a> or 74HC input unless a 'pull-up' resistor of
2.2k<img src="./Electronics Club - 74 Series Logic ICs - families, 74HC, 74HCT, 74LS, open collector output, logic gates, counters, decoders, display drivers_files/ohm.gif" alt="ohm" width="12" height="11"> is connected between
the +5V supply and the input to correct the slightly different logic voltage ranges used.</p>
<p>Note that a <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/cmos.htm">4000</a> series output can drive only one 74LS input.</p>

They are <a href="https://electronicsclub.info/counting.htm#ripple">ripple</a> counters so beware that glitches may occur in logic systems
connected to their outputs due to the slight delay before the later outputs respond to a clock pulse.</p>
<p>The count advances as the <strong>clock</strong> input becomes low (on the falling-edge), this is indicated
by the bar over the clock label. This is the usual clock behaviour of ripple counters and it means
means a counter output can directly drive the clock input of the next counter in a chain.</p>
<p>For normal operation the <strong>reset</strong> input should be low, making it high resets the counter to zero
(0000, QA-QD low).</p>
<p><strong>Counting to less than 15</strong> can be achieved by connecting the appropriate output(s) to the reset input,
using an AND gate if necessary. For example to count 0 to 8 connect QA (1) and QD (8) to reset using an AND gate.</p>

<h2>74160-3 synchronous counters</h2>
<div class="wrap320"><div class="colflex">
<ul>
<li>74160 synchronous decade counter (standard reset)</li>
<li>74161 synchronous 4-bit counter (standard reset)</li>
<li>74162 synchronous decade counter (synchronous reset)</li>
<li>74163 synchronous 4-bit counter (synchronous reset)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>synchronous</strong> counters so their outputs change precisely together on each clock pulse.
This is helpful if you need to connect their outputs to logic gates because it avoids the glitches which
occur with ripple counters.</p>
<p>The count advances as the <strong>clock</strong> input becomes high (on the rising-edge).
The <strong>decade</strong> counters count from 0 to 9 (0000 to 1001 in binary).
The <strong>4-bit</strong> counters count from 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111 in binary).</p>
<p>For normal operation (counting) the <strong>reset</strong>, <strong>preset</strong>, <strong>count&nbsp;enable</strong>
and <strong>carry&nbsp;in</strong> inputs should all be high.
When <strong>count&nbsp;enable</strong> is low the clock input is ignored and counting stops.</p>
<p>The counter may be <strong>preset</strong> by placing the desired binary number on the <strong>inputs&nbsp;A-D</strong>, making
the <strong>preset</strong> input low, and applying a positive pulse to the <strong>clock</strong> input.
The <strong>inputs&nbsp;A-D</strong> may be left unconnected if not required.</p>
<p>The <strong>reset</strong> input is active-low so it should be high (+Vs) for normal operation (counting).
When low it resets the count to zero (0000, QA-QD low), this happens immediately with the
74160 and 74161 (<strong>standard reset</strong>), but with the 74162 and 74163 (<strong>synchronous reset</strong>)
the reset occurs on the rising-edge of the clock input.</p>
<p><strong>Counting to less than the maximum</strong> (15 or 9) can be achieved by connecting the appropriate output(s)
through a NOT or NAND gate to the reset input.
For the 74162 and 74163 (<strong>synchronous reset</strong>) you must use the output(s) representing <strong>one less</strong>
than the reset count you require, e.g. to reset on 7 (counting 0 to 6) use QB (2) and QC (4).</p>

<p>These counters have separate clock inputs for counting up and down.
The count increases as the <strong>up clock</strong> input becomes high (on the rising-edge).
The count decreases as the <strong>down clock</strong> input becomes high (on the rising-edge).
In both cases the other clock input should be high.</p>

When the <strong>reset</strong> input is high it resets the count to zero (0000, QA-QD low).</p>

<p>The appropriate output becomes low in response to the BCD (binary coded decimal) input.

A <strong>common anode</strong> display is required.</p>
<p><strong>Display test</strong> and <strong>blank input</strong> are active-low so they should be high for normal operation.
When <strong>display test</strong> is low all the display segments should light (showing number 8).</p>
<p>If the <strong>blank input</strong> is low the display will be blank when the count input is zero (0000).
This can be used to blank leading zeros when there are several display digits driven by a chain of counters.
To achieve this <strong>blank&nbsp;output</strong> should be connected to <strong>blank&nbsp;input</strong> of the next
display down the chain (the next most significant digit).</p>
<p>The 7447 is intended for BCD (binary coded decimal) which is input values 0 to 9 (0000 to 1001 in binary).
